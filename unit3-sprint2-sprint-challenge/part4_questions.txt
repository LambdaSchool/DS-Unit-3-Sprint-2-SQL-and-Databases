Question #1
The relationship between ‘Employee’ table and ‘Territory’ table is one-to-many.
That is one record in the Employee table can be associated with one or more
records in Territory table.

Question #2
Document store like Mongo DB, which is a type of NoSQL database,
is appropriate for dealing with unstructured data.
Data can be stored in JSON like documents that can very in structure
offering a dynamic, flexible schema. However, it is not appropriate to use with
highly coupled data and for companies such as banks with a large amount of
transactions occurring.

Question #3
NewSQL is blend of traditional SQL and NoSQL databases. It tends to get best of
both sides of traditional SQL and NoSQL. That is to say it is trying to achieve
the balance between high performance and scalability of NoSQL databases while
maintaining the ACID guarantees of traditional SQL databases.
