# %% BuddyMove to SQL
# A Python script by Tobias Reaper
# ---
# Loads the BuddyMove dataset via CSV
# Saves the resulting DataFrame into an SQLite3 database
# And queries the resulting database

# %% Imports
import sqlite3
import os
import pandas as pd

# %% Create the path object
# Where the data is (and will be) located

# The working directory (could un-hardcode it with `os.getcwd()`)
# However, vscode works from the project root

path2 = "DS-Unit-3-Sprint-2-SQL-and-Databases/module1-introduction-to-sql/"

# %% Load the csv into a DataFrame
df1 = pd.read_csv(csv_fullpath)

# %% Confirm it is the expected size / shape
assert df1.shape == (249, 7)
print(df1.shape)
print(df1.head())

# %% Clean up the dataframe column names using pyjanitor
import janitor

# Replace the whitespace in the "User ID" column
# Also makes the column names lowercase
df2 = df1.clean_names()

# %% Clean up the "user_id" column
# Strip the "User" and convert to integer
df2["user_id"] = df2["user_id"].str.strip("User ").astype(int)

# %% Create the database connection
# In this case, it will create a new database file

# Create filepath / filename for the new database
