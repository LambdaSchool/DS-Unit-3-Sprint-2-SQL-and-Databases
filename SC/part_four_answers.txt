In the Northwind DB, what is the type of relationship between Employee and Territory table?

The relationship between the Employee table and the Territory table is that of a 
one-to-many relationship. Each employee can have multiple territories under their domain
but each territory can only relate to one employee. They relate through a 3rd table, 
EmployeeTerritory where each EmployeeID can match up to multiple territories,
but each territory is listed only once.

What is a situation where a document store is appropriate, and what is a situation where it
is not appropriate?
MongoDb (and others like it) are different from relational databases. In relational databases
there is a schema that needs to be followed. In a document store the data is stored in documents
and is more flexible with what kinds of data and how its' stored. The benefit of a document store
is that it is more scalable, so good to use for BigData, and more flexible in what can be stored
and how. The downside of this is that it is not as ACID-compliant as relational databases and so 
it is more susceptible to errors/corruption. A good use case for document stores like MongoDB is 
an e-commerce product catalog, whereas using it for the management of a movie theater, where there
is a very structured relationship between datapoints and an RDBMS would be better.

What is NewSQL and what is it trying to achieve?
NewSQL is an attempt to bridge the gap and get the best of both worlds in data storage. It seeks
to combine the scalability of NoSQL databases with the ACID consistency of relation databases.
It also uses SQL as its interface language.
