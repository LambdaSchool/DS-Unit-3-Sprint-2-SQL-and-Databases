QUESTIONS

In the Northwind database, what is the type of relationship between the Employee and Territory tables?

	The relationship between Employee and Territory tables is many to many assuming there are multiple 
	entries in the Employee table under each unique EmployeeID and if each territory is not unique to EmployeeID. 
	There would be multiple employees for each territory and multiple territories for each employee making 
	it many to many. If TerritoryID is unique to an employee, in the case where only one employee can work
	in each territory, this would be a many to one relationship between the Employee and Territory tables 
	because there could only be one employee for each territory, but multiple terrritories for each employee.

What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is appropriate, and what is a situation where it is not appropriate?

	MongoDB prioritizes for horizontal scalability of non-relational data and the data is distributed 
	over multiple servers. It is appropriate for massive amounts of unstructured data that donâ€™t have 
	a clear schema. It is not appropriate for relational data that is not already joined.

What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?

	NewSQL builds on SQL and NoSQL to preserve the functionality of traditional SQL relational databases, 
	and scalability of NoSQL databases. NewSQL adheres to ACID(atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) 
	for transactional consistency and uses a SQL interface. It aims to achieve improved functionality over 
	SQL and NoSQL by offering high speed transactions for massive amounts of data, scalability, 
	while maintaining ACID.
