*This week we worked with SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.* 

# What was easy about using these technolgies? 

For PostgreSQL, I really liked having a dashboard and API through elephant rather than hosting it locally! This abstracted away some administrative tasks that would've taken far too long to worry about locally. 

# What was hard about these technologies? 
Just learning some syntax, operators, etc. Like I need to internalize how the joins or union compare to sets before I can really start building up momentum with running queries. 

# What more would you like to learn about it? 

I'd like to get a better sense of how to make sure my **test environment** is set up so that i'm **not running too many really costly queries**, or running them just once or twice /day, in the situation of working with an extremely large database.
