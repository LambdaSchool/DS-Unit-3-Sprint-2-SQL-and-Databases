1. In the Northwind database, what is the type of relationship
 between the Employee and Territory tables?

Given that the EMPLOYEE table has a specific EmployeeID per employee 
(aka EmployeeID = Primary Key for the EMPLOYEE table) which matches to
multiple territories in the TERRITORY table (aka EmployeeID = Foreign Key
for TERRITORY table), the relationship can be considered
as ONE TO MANY. 

2. What is a situation where a document store (like MongoDB) is
 appropriate, and what is a situation where it is not appropriate?

MongoDB type document stores are for situations that require high degree
of scaling (i.e. cloud servers with multiple server locations that can
spin up new instances). Situations where MongoDV type document stores
are not required is when relational-based ACID-transaction-type data
is being handled (i.e. wiring money from account to account).

3. What is "NewSQL", and what is it trying to achieve?


NewSQL seeks to provide the scalability of NoSQL AND ACID transactions.
NewSQL's aim is to achieve lower feature/development costs for situations
like handling financial data. It is an attempt at "having your cake and
eating it too."
