"How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL? What was easier, and what was harder?":
-MongoDB and PostgrSQL biggest difference is hpw the data/information is stored.
-In PostgreSQL there are schemas that are used to connect to individual data tables. MongoDB formats and stores the
all the data formated in documents.  The two have unique differences and but in my opinon MongoDB seems simpler/easier
way to store data and PostgreSQL has in my opinion extra steps so its harder.
