Working with MongoDB was much easier than working the PostgreSQL.

With MongoDB, I do not have to concern myself with what data types the
server supports. It is much like working in python, and if I can get my
data into a python dictionary, I can easily use MongoDB. PostgreSQL requires
much more time and effort to get setup.
