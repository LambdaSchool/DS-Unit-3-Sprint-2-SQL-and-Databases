How was working with MongoDB different from working with PostgreSQL? 

Aside from terminology, MongoDB seemed more flexible and freeform compared to working with Postgres.
While that flexibility does seem to make database interactions easier in some respects, 
I can see how that could potentially cause problems as well.

What was easier? 

Creating tables / collections is much easier. In fact, most of the interactions were easier.
In particular, creating tables and adding data seemed very simple, as there is not as many
hard and fast rules as far as inserting the data. Not being forced to work with the SQL query
syntax as strings within Python also made that a little easier.

What was harder?

Getting data out of the database seems like it is more difficult. I haven't dug too deep into creating complex views and aggregate functions, but that aspect of SQL seems to have an advantage.
