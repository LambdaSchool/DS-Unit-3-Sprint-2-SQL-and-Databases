"How was working with MongoDB different from working with
PostgreSQL? What was easier, and what was harder?"

- The largest difference in working with MongoDb and PostgreSQL was the necessity for a schema when working with
PostrgeSQL. When you need a schema in order to work with a database it makes the data much more rigid. Certain situations
call for certain types of necessities for data to have parameters for loading. My ideas for this can help avoid
adding types or values to a DB that are either unnecessary or improper. I am a big fan of structure, although in a case
where you need to have a large variety of data placed in a DB that may not always align with what is previously placed
in the DB, a MongoDB would be the way to go.
