2. MongoDB is useful when used for storing nosql data, a document contains all information in one place \n
        rather than placing the information across multipule tables. \n
        Its mostly used we have a huge amount of data that we need to be scalable \n
        And where the data is not relational \n
        and where a user might need a document with the full data. \n
        A use case is webapps where a user need to pull readily available information.\n
        It not appropriate to use in situations where we need to have a logical relationship between the data,\n
        where we need the data to be structured for manipulation'
