ETL Data Pipeline
Extract Transform Load pipeline
kind of similar to an iol pipeline where one end is connnected to a pump, then it goes down a pipe and at the end of the pip it 
dumps into a resevor thats the EL part of ETL
allot of the nuance is in the T step where you transof the data beween the steps,

Extracting data from a csv pd.to_csv
minimum transformation is getting it to fit into the destination database
Put it into a sql database

Lots of changes possible

there are best practice to building a pipeline but there are no hard
this is how you do xzy

there are ETL's where the distination is a smaller datastructure
in that instance then you would have to reduce the data to fit the destination

Production Database: Database that is being used for Live Work Right Now. websites,services,big money being lost
the right way to do something is to take a full copy of the production database as an anallist database.

usally there is not ML happing in a pipeline, that happends after everything in a ETL pipeline.
