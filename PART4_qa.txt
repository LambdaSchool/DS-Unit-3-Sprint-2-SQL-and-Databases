Question What is a situation where a document store(like MongoDB is appropriate and what is a situation where it is not appropriate?
MongoDB is appropriate in situation where large objects need to be read/write efficiently. The required datatype is a dictionary with key-value pair. Application working with MongoDB, needs to implement schema-on-read library to define appropriate datatype as needed by the application.

MongoDB is a non-relational data storage. And because of this, application with frequent update operation is not appropriate with MongoDB. All the update operation works, are done by the application while MongoDB is only helping with read/write and storage. Hence frequent update operation application, is not efficient with MongoDB.
